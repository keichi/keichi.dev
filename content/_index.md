I am currently an assistant professor at
the [High Performance Computing Laboratory](https://www.hpc.is.tohoku.ac.jp/home-en/)
led by Prof. Hiroyuki Takizawa
at the Cyberscience Center, [Tohoku University](http://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/).
Prior to joining Tohoku University, I was an assistant professor at the Nara
Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST) and a member of the Software
Design and Analysis Laboratory. I also served as a guest faculty at the
[Cybermedia Center](https://www.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/?lang=en), Osaka University.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 at Osaka University, where
I worked under the supervision of Prof. Shinji Shimojo and Prof. Susumu
Date. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I received my Master’s degree in
Computer Science and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Computer
Engineering at Osaka University.

My research mainly focuses on middleware for high-performance computing. In
particular, I study how to create software for efficiently moving data inside
a compute node, between compute nodes and from/to persistent storage on a
large-scale high-performance computing system.
