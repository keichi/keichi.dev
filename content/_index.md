I am currently an associate professor at the Advanced High-Performance Computing Infrastructure
Systems Research Division at [D3 Center](https://www.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/?lang=en), The University of
Osaka. Prior to joining the University of Osaka, I was an assistant professor at [Cyberscience
Center](https://www.cc.tohoku.ac.jp/english/), Tohoku University, and an assistant professor at the
[Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)](https://www.naist.jp/en/).

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 at the University of Osaka, where I worked under the
supervision of Prof. Shinji Shimojo and Prof. Susumu Date. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I
received my Master’s degree in Computer Science and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Computer
Engineering at the University of Osaka.

My research mainly focuses on middleware for high-performance computing. In
particular, I study how to create software for efficiently moving data inside
a compute node, between compute nodes and from/to persistent storage on a
large-scale high-performance computing system.
